# Extensions and monkey-patching for django-stubs

This package contains extensions and monkey-patching functions for the [django-stubs](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs) package. Certain features of django-stubs (i.e. generic django classes that don't define the `__class_getitem__` method) require runtime monkey-patching, which can't be done with type stubs. These extensions were split into a separate package so library consumers don't need `mypy` as a runtime dependency ([#526](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs/pull/526#pullrequestreview-525798031)).

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-stubs-ext
```

## Usage

In your Django application, use the following code:

```py
import django_stubs_ext

django_stubs_ext.monkeypatch()
```

This only needs to be called once, so the call to `monkeypatch` should be placed in your top-level settings.

## Version compatibility

Since django-stubs supports multiple Django versions, this package takes care to only monkey-patch the features needed by your django version, and decides which features to patch at runtime. This is completely safe, as (currently) we only add a `__class_getitem__` method that does nothing:

```py
@classmethod
def __class_getitem__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    return cls
```
